Get started pretty fast and develop your own Bitcoin application.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart ##\r\n\r\n### Installation ###\r\n\r\nInstallation of the official bitcoin core implementation from https://bitcoin.org/en/download\r\n\r\n    ~$ BITCOIN_VERSION=0.9.3 # You may want to change that the current version.\r\n    ~$ wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/${BITCOIN_VERSION}/bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    ~$ tar xf bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    # Change 64 to 32 for 32bit architecture\r\n    ~$ mv bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux/bin/64/* /usr/local/bin \r\n    \r\n### Get your first Bitcoin ###\r\n\r\n    # For testing purpose we want verbose output\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest -printtoconsole\r\n    ... # Lot of output here\r\n    \r\n    # Switch to new console and let the bitcoind running.\r\n    # We generate 101 new blocks (starting from the genesis block),\r\n    # in order to be able to access the first one and get 50 BTC.\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest setgenerate 101\r\n    ... # Wait until all blocks are generated, ~1 minute\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest getbalance\r\n    50.00000000 # <= You should see that or at least a number bigger then zero.\r\n\r\n**Congratulations!** You have now your first BTC that you can spent. \r\n\r\nWhere to go from here? Please read further how to spent this BTC and how to make the whole a little bit more effective, with less typing and more automated.\r\n\r\n### Preparing your working environment ###\r\n\r\n    # We don't want to type each time `bitcoind -regtest`.\r\n    # The command `br` is easier to type and easy to remember (the beginning letters of the command).\r\n    ~$ echo 'alias br=\"bitcoind -regtest\"' >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc\r\n    \r\n    \r\n## TODO ##\r\n\r\n* Provide scripts that automate the whole node setup and spending process, e.g. by simulated random transfers.\r\n* Explain how the blockchain could be stored in a SQL database and accessed via your application.\r\n* Describe how the node can be virtualized with vagrant or docker.\r\n\r\n## Help this project ##\r\n\r\nPlease help us to extend and improve this project.\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2. Make your changes.\r\n3.
