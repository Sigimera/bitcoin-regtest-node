Get started pretty fast and develop your\r\nown Bitcoin application.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started ##\r\n\r\n### Quickstart ###\r\n\r\n*TODO: Add helper scripts and explain here to execute them and in what order.*\r\n\r\n### Manual Installation ###\r\n\r\nInstallation of the official bitcoin core implementation from\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/download\r\n\r\n    ~$ BITCOIN_VERSION=0.9.3 # You may want to change this value to the current version.\r\n    ~$ wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/${BITCOIN_VERSION}/bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    ~$ tar xf bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    # Change 64 to 32 for 32bit architecture\r\n    ~$ mv bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux/bin/64/* /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\n### Get your first Bitcoin ###\r\n\r\n    # For testing purpose we want verbose output\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest -printtoconsole\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nSwitch to new console and let the bitcoind running. We generate 101 new blocks\r\n(starting from the genesis block), in order to be able to access the first one\r\nand get 50 BTC.\r\n\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest setgenerate 101\r\n    ... # Wait until all blocks are generated, ~1 minute\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest getbalance\r\n    50.00000000 # <= You should see that or at least a number bigger then zero.\r\n\r\n**Congratulations!** You have now your first BTC that you can spent.\r\n\r\nWhere to go from here? Please read further how to spent this BTC and how to make\r\n the whole a little bit more effective, with less typing and more automated.\r\n\r\n### Preparing your working environment ###\r\n\r\n    # We don't want to type each time `bitcoind -regtest`.\r\n    # The command `br` is easier to type and easy to remember (the beginning letters of the command).\r\n    ~$ echo 'alias br=\"bitcoind -regtest\"' >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n\r\n* [AUTOMATION] Provide scripts that automate the whole node setup and spending\r\nprocess, e.g.by simulated random transfers.\r\n* [FEATURE] Explain how the blockchain could be stored in a SQL database and\r\naccessed via your application.\r\n* [PORTABILITY] Describe how the node can be virtualized with vagrant or docker.\r\nProvide also the related scripts and configuration files.\r\n* [SECURITY] Add the signature file, of bitcoin-core, to this repository and\r\nexplain how to check it.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n\r\nThe script, that produces the following output, will be provided shortly. It\r\nshutdowns a previous running bitcoind instance, deletes the old regtest\r\nblockchain, creates a new one and mines 101 blocks, in order to get 50 BTC.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigimera/bitcoin-regtest-node/master/screenshots/script_fresh_regtest_start.png\">\r\n\r\n## Support this project ##\r\n\r\nPlease help us to extend and improve this project.\r\n\r\n1.
