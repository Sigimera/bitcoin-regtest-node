Get started pretty fast and develop your\r\nown Bitcoin application.\r\n\r\n### Why this project?\r\n\r\nThis collection of instructions, with related scripts, should help Bitcoin\r\napplication developers. Instead of spending hours with setting up a testing\r\nenvironment, the developer can focus on her application. The created environment\r\nallows the complete testing of the Bitcoin part, without spending real money or\r\ndelays. The environment is reproducible and different scenarios, e.g. collection\r\nof transactions in a predefined order, can be created, but also deleted again.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the testnet3 Bitcoin network, this environment is not\r\ndependent on external nodes. All happens locally and could be fully controlled\r\nby the developer.\r\n\r\n### Who should use this project?\r\n\r\n* **Bitcoin Application Develpers:** The main target audience are developers\r\nthat need a deterministic and reproducible environment for Bitcoin application\r\ndevelopment and testing.\r\n* **People interested in how the Bitcoin blockchain works:** By running a\r\ncomplete blockchain locally, it is easy to play around with different scenarios\r\nand multiple nodes. It is not only a lot of fun, to play around with an own\r\nblockchain, but improves the understanding of how a decentralized ledger works.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started ##\r\n\r\n### Quickstart ###\r\n\r\n*TODO: Add helper scripts and explain here to execute them and in what order.*\r\n\r\n### Manual Installation ###\r\n\r\nInstallation of the official bitcoin core implementation from\r\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/download\r\n\r\n    ~$ BITCOIN_VERSION=0.9.3 # You may want to change this value to the current version.\r\n    ~$ wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/${BITCOIN_VERSION}/bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    ~$ tar xf bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux.tar.gz\r\n    # Change 64 to 32 for 32bit architecture\r\n    ~$ mv bitcoin-${BITCOIN_VERSION}-linux/bin/64/* /usr/local/bin\r\n\r\n### Get your first Bitcoin ###\r\n\r\n    # For testing purpose we want verbose output\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest -printtoconsole\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nSwitch to new console and let the bitcoind running. We generate 101 new blocks\r\n(starting from the genesis block), in order to be able to access the first one\r\nand get 50 BTC.\r\n\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest setgenerate 101\r\n    ... # Wait until all blocks are generated, ~1 minute\r\n    ~$ bitcoind -regtest getbalance\r\n    50.00000000 # <= You should see that or at least a number bigger then zero.\r\n\r\n**Congratulations!** You have now your first BTC that you can spent.\r\n\r\nWhere to go from here? Please read further how to spent this BTC and how to make\r\n the whole a little bit more effective, with less typing and more automated.\r\n\r\n### Preparing your working environment ###\r\n\r\n    # We don't want to type each time `bitcoind -regtest`.\r\n    # The command `br` is easier to type and easy to remember (the beginning letters of the command).\r\n    ~$ echo 'alias br=\"bitcoind -regtest\"' >> ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n\r\n* [AUTOMATION] Provide scripts that automate the whole node setup and spending\r\nprocess, e.g.by simulated random transfers.\r\n* [FEATURE] Explain how the blockchain could be stored in a SQL database and\r\naccessed via your application.\r\n* [PORTABILITY] Describe how the node can be virtualized with vagrant or docker.\r\nProvide also the related scripts and configuration files.\r\n* [SECURITY] Add the signature file, of bitcoin-core, to this repository and\r\nexplain how to check it.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n\r\nThe script, that produces the following output, will be provided shortly. It\r\nshutdowns a previous running bitcoind instance, deletes the old regtest\r\nblockchain, creates a new one and mines 101 blocks, in order to get 50 BTC.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sigimera/bitcoin-regtest-node/master/screenshots/script_fresh_regtest_start.png\">\r\n\r\n## Support this project ##\r\n\r\nPlease help us to extend and improve this project.\r\n\r\n1.
